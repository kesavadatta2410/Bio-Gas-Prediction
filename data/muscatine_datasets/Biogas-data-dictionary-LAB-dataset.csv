Biogas,Average daily biogas flow ,Cubic feet per minute,float,0-500
,,,,
The LABS-raw file has been pre-cleaned using the following steps: ,,,,
Calculated Biogas flow as total biogas volume in cubic feet  divided by 1440 minutes per day,,,,
Rows with no Biogas flow information deleted (4/6/21-6/27/21),,,,
Removed VFA analysis prior to 4/21/20 due to different method,,,,
"Removed VS and COD data if it matched the previous data point (ex. Fri: 62100, Sat: 62100, Sun: 62100, removed Saturday and Sunday as analyses were only conducted on weekdays) ",,,,
"Filled in HSW VS and HSW COD as 0 up to 3/16/20, then used the first measurement of VS and COD as the values until the first measurement",,,,
"Deleted 2 temperatures assumed to be typos (4/4/20, 8/30/22), 1 pH (10/12/20), 1 VFA (8/11/20)",,,,
